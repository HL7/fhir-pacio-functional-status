Title:          "PACIO Functional Status"
Description:    "An exchange of functional status observation for a patient. This profile is used for exchanging a single observation data generally included in a set of observation data collected through the use of a structured resource (e.g. assessment tool, instrument, or screen)."

* subject 1..1
* subject only Reference(USCorePatient)

* code from LNCVS (extensible)

* performer 1..*
* performer only Reference(USCorePractitioner or USCorePractitionerRole or USCoreOrganization)
