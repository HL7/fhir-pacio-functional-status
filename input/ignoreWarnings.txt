== Suppressed Messages ==

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples
# Suppress warning about Jira specification not being update to date when comparing jira-current.xml with jira-new.xml
# WARNING: The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG. A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts. To see the differences, perform a file compare on 'template/jira-current.xml' (a normalized view of what is in Github) and 'template/jira-new.xml' (reflects current IG content)

# The following LOINC answer list is not supported by terminology server. NOTE: LOINC answer lists are value sets. The value set identifier "http://loinc.org/vs/[id]" identifies a value set that contains a set of LOINC codes.
The valueSet reference http://loinc.org/vs/LL4309-2 on element Extension.value[x] could not be resolved

# The URL is good for downloading the questionnaire as a JSON resource
The questionnaire 'https://api.logicahealth.org/PACIO/open/Questionnaire/MDS3.0-NC-1.17' could not be resolved, so no validation can be performed against the base questionnaire
